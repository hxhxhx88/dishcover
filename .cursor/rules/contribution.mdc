- The documentation in `@docs` is the single source of truth.
- The `@docs` folder is organized by topic. You are expected to find the relevant file yourself.
- Before implementing any feature or fix, you MUST:
  - Read `@CONTRIBUTING.md` first.
  - Find and read relevant doc in `@doc`.
  - Follow the guide strictly.
