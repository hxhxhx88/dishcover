# Naming rules

Use **reverse order** when naming both files and code entities. This means that the core type or purpose comes first, followed by any qualifiers or specifics. For example:

- A component for a user table should be named `table-user.tsx`, with the component name `TableUser`.
- A server action for creating a new user should be named `action-user-create.ts`, with the function or constant named `actionUserCreate`.

This approach has several benefits:

- It groups related files together in the code editor, improving discoverability and organization.
- It makes it easier to quickly understand the role and context of each file or code element.
