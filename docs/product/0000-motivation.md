# Motivation and idea

## The problem

As a native Chinese speaker with functional English, navigating menus in foreign restaurants is consistently frustrating — especially in non-English-speaking countries like France or Brazil. Staring at an unfamiliar menu with no context makes ordering stressful and hit-or-miss.

## The workaround

The current workaround is to photograph the menu, drop the images into an AI app (Gemini, ChatGPT), and ask it to translate, organize, and recommend dishes. When ordering something like a steak, photographing the wine list and asking for pairing suggestions is a natural extension of the same flow.

## The insight

This workflow is useful enough to do repeatedly — which means it's useful enough to build. DishCover automates exactly what's being done by hand: capture a menu, understand it, and get personalized recommendations from it.
