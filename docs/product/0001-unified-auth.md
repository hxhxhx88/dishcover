# Unified authentication

This document describes the unified sign-in and sign-up process using email and OTP.

## Overview

The authentication flow is designed to be simple and passwordless. Users enter their email address, receive a one-time password (OTP), and are either signed in or signed up depending on whether an account already exists.

## User flow

- User visits the authentication page.
- User enters their email address.
- System sends an OTP to the provided email.
- User enters the OTP.
- System verifies the OTP.
- System checks if the user account exists.
  - If yes, the user is signed in.
  - If no, a new account is created, and the user is signed in.
