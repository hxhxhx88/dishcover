## Target users

- Travelers and expats encountering menus in unfamiliar languages
- Diners with dietary preferences or restrictions who want smarter ordering, regardless of language

## MVP scope

- Preference-based dish recommendations
- Wine and beverage pairing suggestions when a drinks menu is detected
- Scan history (local, last 20 sessions)

### Out of scope

- AR overlay on physical menus
- Ordering or reservation integration
- Nutrition tracking
- Offline mode
- QR code menus

## Features

### Menu capture

User photographs one or more pages of a menu using the device camera or photo library. All pages are processed together as a single session.

- Users can add pages sequentially before processing
- Users can import from the photo library
- Captured pages are previewed before submission
- Supported formats: JPEG, HEIC, PNG
- Up to 10 pages per session
- Low-quality or blurry images surface a retake prompt
- Non-menu images return a graceful error message

### Menu digitization and translation

Captured images are sent to Gemini Vision. The model extracts and structures menu items and translates them into the user's display language.

- Detects menu sections (starters, mains, desserts, drinks, etc.)
- Extracts: item name (original and translated), description, price if visible
- Output language follows the device locale by default; user can override in settings
- Target processing time: under 15 seconds for up to 5 pages
- Items that cannot be translated are shown in their original language with a note
- Handwritten menus are processed on a best-effort basis with a quality warning
- User preferences (e.g. dietary tags) may be included in the prompt to Gemini for better recommendations; no other data is stored or transmitted beyond the inference call

### Structured menu display

The digitized menu is displayed in a browsable, categorized layout.

- Items grouped by detected section
- Each item shows: translated name, original name (secondary), description, price
- Sections are collapsible
- Keyword search across all items
- Items flagged by the recommendation engine show a visual indicator
- Menus with no detected sections are grouped under "All items"

### Personalized recommendations

After digitization, users can describe their preferences to get dish suggestions from the current menu.

- Free-text input (e.g. "first time here, want something local") and optional quick-select tags (Vegetarian, Vegan, No pork, Seafood, Local specialty, Light meal)
- Returns 3–5 recommendations with a short reason per dish
- Recommendations are shown inline in the menu and in a "For you" section
- Skipping preferences surfaces a generic recommendation if the model can infer one
- Preferences are sent to Gemini alongside the menu data and are not stored

### Wine and beverage pairing

When a drinks or wine section is detected in the scanned images, pairing suggestions are offered for the user's selected or recommended dishes.

- Auto-detected; not shown if no drinks section is found
- Tap a dish to see "Pair with" suggestions from the detected beverage list
- Shows drink name and a brief pairing reason
- Applies to wine, beer, cocktails, and non-alcoholic options
- For large drink lists, the model returns the top 3 matches per dish
- The drinks menu and food menu must be captured in the same session

### Scan history

Previous scan sessions are saved on-device so users can revisit menus.

- Saved per session: date, restaurant name if detectable, first-page thumbnail, full digitized content
- Browsable in chronological order
- Sessions can be deleted individually
- Maximum 20 sessions; oldest is removed when the limit is exceeded
- If the restaurant name cannot be detected, the session is labeled "Menu – [date]"
- History is local only; clearing app data removes all history

## Technical notes

- AI provider: Gemini (Google)
- i18n: LinguiJS with `expo-localization` for device locale detection; user override stored in local app settings
- Local persistence: `expo-secure-store` and/or `AsyncStorage` (no backend required for MVP)
- No user account or authentication in MVP
